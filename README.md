## 💰 PennyWise – Full Stack Expense Tracker

🚀 PennyWise is a fully deployed Full-Stack web application that helps users track and visualize their daily expenses.
It’s built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and integrates interactive charts, CRUD operations, and live deployment – proving complete end-to-end development skills.


 ## 🌍 Deployment

🔗 [Frontend (React): Live on Vercel](https://penny-wise-f2m5.vercel.app/)

🔗 [Backend (Express API): Live on Render](https://pennywise-satc.onrender.com)

✅ Both are deployed and working together as a real-world full-stack project.


## 🌟 Why PennyWise?

Many projects are either just frontend demos or basic backend APIs.
PennyWise is different – it’s a full-stack application with:

A React + Tailwind + ShadCN/UI frontend.

A Node.js + Express backend connected to MongoDB Atlas.

Deployed frontend on Vercel and backend on Render with continuous uptime via UptimeRobot.

👉 This demonstrates real-world full-stack deployment skills, not just coding.

## 🚀 Features

📝 Full CRUD Operations – Add, edit, delete, and view expenses.

📊 Charts & Analytics – Interactive Pie and Bar charts (Recharts).

👨‍💻 End-to-End Stack – Complete integration from database to frontend.

☁️ Live Deployment – Accessible online, not just local.

🎨 Modern UI – Responsive, clean, and minimal design.
